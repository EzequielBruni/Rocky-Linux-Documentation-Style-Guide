# Rocky Linux Beginner Docs Style Guide

## Intro

Beginner documentation is for, you guessed it, beginners! This is the documentation where you can go a little wild, writing-wise. Feel free to use metaphors and analogies to help newbie sysadmins learn the basic concepts of installing Rocky Linux and managing their system.

This content in particular is something that we want to feel welcoming, and non-threatening. That stage of learning where everything is new and a potential headache is a fragile time. It's far too easy to lose people who look at a tutorial and think, "Wow. I am *never* going to get that.

When listing prerequisites, don't forget to link to our other guides, to make sure that beginner readers have a strong foundation in what they need to know.
